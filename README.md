# Sentimental Insights

Immerse yourself in a world of knowledge and adventure with books, the most popular pastime for millions of people worldwide. With the power to expand our minds and foster knowledge sharing, books are a treasured commodity that continue to be extensively purchased. Non-fiction books have been proven to outsell their fiction counterparts, with biographies and general fiction standing out as fan favorites.

However, what sets one book apart from the others? What makes a book resonate with readers, earning it success and praise? Researchers have long been intrigued by the answer to this question, as there is no precise method to comprehend the reader's psyche and what truly entices them about a book.

This project aims to delve deeper into the reader's mindset. I take a fresh approach to researching this topic by asking non-traditional questions, such as: "What is the author's writing style?" and "How does the author's writing style affect the reader while reading?" I am also exploring the impact of positive and negative sentences in books on a reader's judgment when writing reviews about the book.

Reviews play a crucial role in the decision-making process for many readers, providing valuable insights into a book's story, genre, tone, and quality. In fact, according to The Book Network, "Reviews give you the lowdown of the story, genre and tone of the book, you also get a valuable impression of its quality." My project seeks to understand the reader's mindset by analyzing these reviews and identifying the key factors that influence a reader's perception of a book.

Join me on this exciting journey as I unravel the mysteries of the reader's psyche and discover what makes a book truly great.
