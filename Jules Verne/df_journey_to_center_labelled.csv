negative,road really present descend dark subterraneous bowels mother earth thrice unhappy saknussemm really told truth shall certainly lost midst labyrinth subterraneous galleries volcano
neutral,evidence prove sneffels really extinct
neutral,proof eruption shortly take place
neutral,monster slept soundly since 1219 follow never wake
neutral,wake become us
positive,questions worth thinking upon reflected long deeply
neutral,could lie search sleep without dreaming eruptions
neutral,thought objected reduced state dross ashes

positive,prove concrete mass lava extend centre earth
neutral,think yet done much vertical way
neutral,puts head boy
neutral,asked uncle mildly
positive,well appears descended far level sea find rather hotter
neutral,according system said uncle thermometer say
positive,scarcely fifteen degrees reaumur increase nine since departure
neutral,well conclusion bring
neutral,inquired professor
neutral,deduction draw simple
neutral,according exact observations augmentation temperature interior earth one degree every hundred feet
positive,certain local causes may considerably modify figure
neutral,thus yakoust siberia remarked heat increases degree every thirty six feet
positive,difference evidently depends conductibility certain rocks
neutral,neighborhood extinct volcano remarked elevation temperature one degree every five twenty feet
positive,let us go upon calculation favorable calculate
neutral,calculate away boy
neutral,nothing easier said pulling notebook pencil
neutral,nine times one hundred twenty five feet make depth eleven hundred twenty five feet
neutral,archimedes could spoken geometrically
neutral,well
