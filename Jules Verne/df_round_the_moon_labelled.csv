negative,travelers recovered false alarm breakfasted merrily
positive,ate good deal talked
positive,confidence greater incident algebra succeed said michel ardan arrive safely
negative,launched obstacle us stones way road open ship battling sea open balloon battling wind ship reach destination balloon go pleases cannot projectile attain end aim attain said barbicane
positive,honor americans added michel ardan people could bring enterprise happy termination one could produce president barbicane
negative,ah longer uneasy begin think become us
negative,shall get right royally weary barbicane nicholl made gesture denial
positive,provided contingency friends replied michel speak chess draughts cards dominoes disposal nothing wanting billiard table exclaimed barbicane brought away trifles certainly replied michel distract also laudable intention endowing selenite smoking divans friend said barbicane moon inhabited inhabitants must appeared thousands years earth cannot doubt star much older
neutral,selenites existed hundreds thousands years brain organization human brain already invented invented even may invent future ages
positive,nothing learn us everything learn said michel believe artists like phidias michael angelo raphael yes poets like homer virgil milton lamartine hugo sure philosophers like plato aristotle descartes kant doubt scientific men like archimedes euclid pascal newton could swear comic writers like arnal photographers like like nadar certain friend barbicane strong even stronger selenites tried communicate earth
negative,launched lunar projectile terrestrial regions told never done said barbicane seriously
positive,indeed added nicholl would easier us two reasons first attraction moon surface six times less earth would allow projectile rise easily secondly would enough send projectile 8 000 leagues instead 80 000 would require force projection ten times less strong continued michel repeat done repeat said barbicane told done thousands years man appeared earth projectile projectile
neutral,demand see projectile friend replied barbicane sea covers five sixths globe
positive,may draw five good reasons supposing lunar projectile ever launched bottom atlantic pacific unless sped crevasse period crust earth yet hardened old barbicane said michel answer everything bow wisdom
positive,one hypothesis would suit better others selenites older wiser invented gunpowder moment diana joined conversation sonorous barking
neutral,asking breakfast
positive,ah said michel ardan discussion forgotten diana satellite immediately good sized pie given dog devoured hungrily
positive,see barbicane said michel made second noah ark projectile borne us moon couple every kind domestic animal dare say room would failed us oh said michel might squeezed little fact replied nicholl cows bulls horses ruminants would useful lunar continent unfortunately car could neither made stable shed well might least brought donkey little donkey courageous beast old silenus loved mount
positive,love old donkeys least favored animals creation beaten alive even dead make asked barbicane
positive,said michel make skins drums barbicane nicholl could help laughing ridiculous remark
positive,cry merry companion stopped
neutral,latter leaning spot satellite lay
positive,rose saying good satellite longer ill ah said nicholl
negative,answered michel dead
negative,added piteous tone embarrassing
negative,much fear poor diana leave progeny lunar regions indeed unfortunate satellite survived wound
negative,quite dead
neutral,michel ardan looked friends rueful countenance
neutral,one question presents said barbicane
negative,cannot keep dead body dog us next forty eight hours
positive,certainly replied nicholl scuttles fixed hinges let
positive,open one throw body space president thought moments said yes must time taking great precautions asked michel
neutral,two reasons understand answered barbicane
positive,first relates air shut projectile must lose little possible manufacture air part
positive,make oxygen worthy michel regard must watch apparatus furnish oxygen great quantity excess would bring us serious physiological troubles
positive,make oxygen make azote medium lungs absorb ought remain intact azote escape rapidly open scuttles oh
negative,time throwing poor satellite said michel
positive,agreed must act quickly second reason asked michel
negative,second reason must let outer cold excessive penetrate projectile shall frozen death sun sun warms projectile absorbs rays warm vacuum floating moment
negative,air heat diffused light darkness cold sun rays strike direct
negative,temperature temperature produced radiation stars say terrestrial globe would undergo sun disappeared one day feared replied nicholl
neutral,knows said michel ardan
neutral,admitting sun go might happen earth might move away said barbicane michel ideas continued michel know 1861 earth passed tail comet
positive,let us suppose comet whose power attraction greater sun
neutral,terrestrial orbit bend toward wandering star earth becoming satellite drawn distance rays sun action surface might happen indeed replied barbicane consequences displacement need formidable suppose heat cold would equalized globe
positive,calculated earth carried along course comet 1861 perihelion nearest approach sun would undergone heat 28 000 times greater summer
negative,heat sufficient evaporate waters would formed thick ring cloud would modified excessive temperature hence compensation cold aphelion heat perihelion many degrees asked nicholl temperature planetary spaces estimated formerly replied barbicane greatly exagerated calculations fourier french academy science supposed exceed 60 centigrade zero pooh said michel nothing much replied barbicane temperature observed polar regions melville island fort reliance 76 fahrenheit zero mistake said nicholl
neutral,pouillet another savant estimates temperature space 250 fahrenheit zero
negative,shall however able verify calculations present solar rays beating directly upon thermometer would give contrary high temperature
negative,arrive moon fifteen days night either face shall leisure make experiment satellite lies vacuum mean vacuum asked michel
positive,perfectly absolutely void air air replaced nothing whatever ether replied barbicane
positive,pray ether ether friend agglomeration imponderable atoms relatively dimensions far removed celestial bodies space
neutral,atoms vibratory motion produce light heat universe proceeded burial satellite
negative,merely drop space way sailors drop body sea president barbicane suggested must act quickly lose little possible air whose elasticity would rapidly spread space
positive,bolts right scuttle opening measured twelve inches across carefully drawn michel quite grieved prepared launch dog space
positive,glass raised powerful lever enabled overcome pressure inside air walls projectile turned rapidly hinges satellite thrown
positive,scarcely particle air could escaped operation successful later barbicane fear dispose rubbish encumbered car
positive,time five hours forty minutes half assigned sojourn projectile already accomplished nearly seven tenths way
positive,peculiarity due regularly decreasing speed
positive,observed earth lower window looked like nothing dark spot drowned solar rays
neutral,crescent cloudy light
neutral,next day midnight earth would new moment moon would full
neutral,orb night nearing line followed projectile meet given hour
positive,around black vault studded brilliant points seemed move slowly great distance relative size seem change
neutral,sun stars appeared exactly us upon earth
positive,moon considerably larger travelers glasses powerful allow yet make useful observations upon surface reconnoiter topographically geologically
neutral,thus time passed never ending conversations moon
positive,one brought forward contingent particular facts barbicane nicholl always serious michel ardan always enthusiastic
positive,projectile situation direction incidents might happen precautions necessitated fall moon inexhaustible matters conjecture
positive,breakfasting question michel relating projectile provoked rather curious answer barbicane worth repeating
negative,michel supposing roughly stopped still formidable initial speed wished know consequences stoppage would
negative,said barbicane see could stopped let us suppose said michel
negative,impossible supposition said practical barbicane unless impulsive force failed even speed would diminish degrees would stopped suddenly admit struck body space body enormous meteor met said nicholl projectile would broken thousand pieces replied barbicane burned death burned exclaimed michel jove
negative,sorry happen see would seen replied barbicane
neutral,known heat modification motion
positive,water warmed say heat added particles set motion well said michel ingenious theory true one worthy friend explains every phenomenon caloric
neutral,heat motion atoms simple oscillation particles body
negative,apply brake train train comes stop becomes motion previously possessed
neutral,transformed heat brake becomes hot
neutral,grease axles wheels
positive,prevent heating heat would generated motion thus lost transformation yes understand replied michel perfectly
negative,example run long time swimming perspiring large drops obliged stop
positive,simply motion changed heat barbicane could help smiling michel reply returning theory said thus case shock would projectile ball falls burning state struck metal plate motion turned heat
positive,consequently affirm projectile struck meteor speed thus suddenly checked would raised heat great enough turn vapor instantaneously asked nicholl would happen earth motion stop suddenly temperature would raised pitch said barbicane would reduced vapor well said michel way ending earth greatly simplify things earth fell upon sun asked nicholl
positive,according calculation replied barbicane fall would develop heat equal produced 16 000 globes coal equal bulk terrestrial globe good additional heat sun replied michel ardan inhabitants uranus neptune would doubtless complain must perished cold planets thus friends said barbicane motion suddenly stopped produces heat
positive,theory allows us infer heat solar disc fed hail meteors falling incessantly surface
neutral,even calculated oh dear murmured michel figures coming even calculated continued imperturbable barbicane shock meteor sun ought produce heat equal 4 000 masses coal equal bulk solar heat asked michel
neutral,equal produced combustion stratum coal surrounding sun depth forty seven miles heat would able boil two billions nine hundred millions cubic myriameters 2 water 2 myriameter equal rather 10 936 cubic yards english
neutral,roast us exclaimed michel
positive,replied barbicane terrestrial atmosphere absorbs four tenths solar heat besides quantity heat intercepted earth billionth part entire radiation see best said michel atmosphere useful invention allows us breathe prevents us roasting yes said nicholl unfortunately moon bah said michel always hopeful
neutral,inhabitants must breathe
neutral,longer must left enough oxygen three people bottom ravines weight cause accumulate climb mountains michel rising went look lunar disc shone intolerable brilliancy
positive,jove said must hot without considering replied nicholl day lasts 360 hours compensate said barbicane nights length heat restored radiation temperature planetary space pretty country exclaimed michel
neutral,never mind
positive,wish
neutral,ah
positive,dear comrades rather curious earth moon see rise horizon recognize shape continents say oneself america europe follow lose sun rays
positive,bye barbicane selenites eclipses yes eclipses sun replied barbicane centers three orbs line earth middle
positive,partial earth cast like screen upon solar disc allows greater portion seen asked nicholl total eclipse
positive,cone shadow cast earth extend beyond moon yes take consideration refraction produced terrestrial atmosphere
neutral,take refraction consideration
positive,thus let lower case delta horizontal parallel p apparent semidiameter oh said michel
positive,speak plainly man algebra well replied barbicane popular language mean distance moon earth sixty terrestrial radii length cone shadow account refraction reduced less forty two radii
positive,result eclipses moon finds beyond cone pure shadow sun sends rays edges also center said michel merry tone eclipses ought simply solar rays weakened refraction atmosphere pass extinguished greater part reason satisfies replied michel
neutral,besides shall see get
positive,tell barbicane believe moon old comet idea yes replied michel amiable swagger ideas sort idea spring michel answered nicholl
negative,well plagiarist doubt
negative,according ancients arcadians pretend ancestors inhabited earth moon became satellite
positive,starting fact scientific men seen moon comet whose orbit one day bring near earth held attraction truth hypothesis asked michel
positive,none whatever said barbicane proof moon preserved trace gaseous envelope always accompanies comets continued nicholl becoming earth satellite could moon perihelion pass near sun evaporation get rid gaseous substances possible friend nicholl probable faith know ah exclaimed michel hundred volumes might make know ah
neutral,indeed
neutral,time asked barbicane
neutral,three clock answered nicholl
neutral,time goes said michel conversation scientific men

positive,seemed three friends though present conditions ideas shot brains leaves shoot first warmth spring
neutral,felt bewildered
positive,middle questions answers crossed nicholl put one question find immediate solution
positive,ah indeed said well go moon get back two interlocutors looked surprised
neutral,one would thought possibility occurred first time
negative,mean nicholl asked barbicane gravely
neutral,ask means leave country added michel yet arrived seems rather inopportune say wishing draw back replied nicholl repeat question ask shall return know nothing answered barbicane
positive,said michel known return would never started answer cried nicholl
positive,quite approve michel words said barbicane add question real interest
neutral,later think advisable return take counsel together
positive,columbiad projectile step certainly
positive,ball without gun gun replied barbicane manufactured
neutral,powder made
negative,neither metals saltpeter coal fail depths moon need go 8 000 leagues order fall upon terrestrial globe virtue mere laws weight enough said michel animation
positive,let longer question returning already entertained long
positive,communicating former earthly colleagues difficult means meteors launched lunar volcanoes well thought michel said barbicane convinced tone voice
positive,laplace calculated force five times greater gun would suffice send meteor moon earth one volcano greater power propulsion hurrah exclaimed michel meteors handy postmen cost nothing
positive,shall able laugh post office administration
neutral,think think capital idea
neutral,fasten thread projectile could exchanged telegrams earth deuce answered nicholl
neutral,consider weight thread 250 000 miles long nothing nothing
neutral,could trebled columbiad charge could quadrupled quintupled exclaimed michel verb took higher intonation time
positive,one little objection make proposition replied barbicane rotary motion globe thread would wound round like chain capstan would inevitably brought us ground thirty nine stars union said michel nothing impracticable ideas day ideas worthy j maston
positive,notion return earth j maston able come us yes come replied barbicane worthy courageous comrade
neutral,besides easier
neutral,columbiad still buried soil florida
neutral,cotton nitric acid wanted wherewith manufacture pyroxyle

negative,three traveling companions acted upon unaccountable influence intoxication inflamed air set respiratory apparatus fire fell motionless bottom projectile
negative,whence cause singular intoxication consequences might disastrous
positive,simple blunder michel fortunately nicholl able correct time
positive,perfect swoon lasted minutes captain recovering first soon collected scattered senses
negative,although breakfasted two hours felt gnawing hunger eaten anything several days
neutral,everything stomach brain overexcited highest degree
negative,got demanded michel supplementary repast
neutral,michel utterly done answer
positive,nicholl tried prepare tea destined help absorption dozen sandwiches
negative,first tried get fire struck match sharply
positive,surprise see sulphur shine extraordinary brilliancy almost unbearable eye

positive,degrees three friends recovered intoxication obliged sleep sober oxygen drunkard wine
positive,michel learned share responsibility incident much disconcerted
negative,unexpected drunkenness broke monotony journey
negative,many foolish things said influence also quickly forgotten
positive,added merry frenchman sorry tasted little heady gas
positive,know friends curious establishment might founded rooms oxygen people whose system weakened could hours live active life
positive,fancy parties room saturated heroic fluid theaters kept high pressure passion souls actors spectators
positive,fire enthusiasm
neutral,instead assembly whole people could saturated activity functions supplement life would derive
positive,exhausted nation might make great strong one know one state old europe ought put regime oxygen sake health michel spoke much animation one might fancied tap still open
negative,words barbicane soon shattered enthusiasm
positive,well friend michel said inform us chickens came mixed concert chickens yes indeed half dozen chickens fine cock walking flapping wings chattering
negative,ah awkward things exclaimed michel
positive,oxygen made revolt want chickens asked barbicane
negative,acclimatize moon jove hide joke worthy president simple joke proved miserable failure
positive,wanted set free lunar continent without saying anything
positive,oh would amazement seeing earthly winged animals pecking lunar fields rascal unmitigated rascal replied barbicane want oxygen mount head
positive,always influence gas always foolish ah says wise replied michel ardan
positive,philosophical reflection three friends set restoring order projectile
negative,chickens cock reinstated coop
positive,proceeding operation barbicane two companions desired perception new phenomenon
neutral,moment leaving earth weight projectile objects enclosed subject increasing diminution
negative,could prove loss projectile moment would arrive would sensibly felt upon utensils instruments used
negative,needless say scale would show loss weight destined weight object would lost exactly much object spring steelyard example tension independent attraction would given estimate loss
positive,know attraction otherwise called weight proportion densities bodies inversely squares distances
negative,hence effect earth alone space celestial bodies suddenly annihilated projectile according newton laws would weigh less got farther earth without ever losing weight entirely terrestrial attraction would always made felt whatever distance
neutral,reality time must come projectile would longer subject law weight allowing celestial bodies whose effect could set zero
neutral,indeed projectile course traced earth moon
positive,distanced earth terrestrial attraction diminished lunar attraction rose proportion
positive,must come point two attractions would neutralize projectile would possess weight longer
neutral,moon earth densities equal point would equal distance two orbs
positive,taking different densities consideration easy reckon point would situated 47 60ths whole journey e 78 514 leagues earth
positive,point body principle speed displacement would remain immovable forever attracted equally orbs drawn toward one toward
positive,projectile impulsive force correctly calculated would attain point without speed lost trace weight well objects within
neutral,would happen
neutral,three hypotheses presented
neutral,1
positive,either would retain certain amount motion pass point equal attraction fall upon moon virtue excess lunar attraction terrestrial
neutral,2
positive,speed failing unable reach point equal attraction would fall upon moon virtue excess lunar attraction terrestrial
neutral,3
positive,lastly animated sufficient speed enable reach neutral point sufficient pass would remain forever suspended spot like pretended tomb mahomet zenith nadir
positive,situation barbicane clearly explained consequences traveling companions greatly interested
positive,know projectile reached neutral point situated distance especially neither objects enclosed projectile would longer subject laws weight
neutral,time travelers admitting action constantly decreasing yet become sensible total absence
negative,day eleven clock morning nicholl accidentally let glass slip hand glass instead falling remained suspended air
positive,ah exclaimed michel ardan rather amusing piece natural philosophy immediately divers objects firearms bottles abandoned held enchantment
positive,diana placed space michel reproduced without trick wonderful suspension practiced caston robert houdin
neutral,indeed dog seem know floating air
positive,three adventurous companions surprised stupefied despite scientific reasonings
neutral,felt carried domain wonders
neutral,felt weight really wanting bodies
neutral,stretched arms attempt fall
neutral,heads shook shoulders
neutral,feet longer clung floor projectile
positive,like drunken men stability
neutral,fancy depicted men without reflection others without shadow
positive,reality neutralizations attractive forces produced men nothing weight weighed nothing
positive,suddenly michel taking spring left floor remained suspended air like murillo monk cusine des anges
positive,two friends joined instantly three formed miraculous ascension center projectile
neutral,believed
neutral,probable
neutral,possible exclaimed michel yet
neutral,ah
neutral,raphael seen us thus assumption would thrown upon canvas assumption cannot last replied barbicane
positive,projectile passes neutral point lunar attraction draw us moon feet upon roof replied michel
positive,said barbicane projectile center gravity low turn degrees portables upset top bottom fact calm michel replied nicholl upset feared thing move projectile evolution imperceptible continued barbicane passed point equal attraction base heavier draw perpendicularly moon order phenomenon take place must passed neutral line pass neutral line cried michel let us sailors cross equator slight side movement brought michel back toward padded side thence took bottle glasses placed space companions drinking merrily saluted line triple hurrah
positive,influence attractions scarcely lasted hour travelers felt insensibly drawn toward floor barbicane fancied conical end projectile varying little normal direction toward moon
positive,inverse motion base approaching first lunar attraction prevailing terrestrial fall toward moon beginning almost imperceptibly yet degrees attractive force would become stronger fall would decided projectile drawn base would turn cone earth fall ever increasing speed surface selenite continent destination would attained
positive,nothing could prevent success enterprise nicholl michel ardan shared barbicane joy
positive,chatted phenomena astonished one particularly neutralization laws weight
positive,michel ardan always enthusiastic drew conclusions purely fanciful
positive,ah worthy friends exclaimed progress make earth could throw weight chain binds us would prisoner set liberty fatigue either arms legs
positive,true order fly earth surface keep oneself suspended air merely play muscles requires strength hundred fifty times greater possess simple act volition caprice would bear us space attraction exist said nicholl smiling could succeed suppressing weight suppress pain anaesthesia would change face modern society yes cried michel full subject destroy weight burdens well said replied barbicane nothing weight nothing would keep place even hat head worthy michel house whose stones adhere weight boat whose stability waves caused weight even ocean whose waves would longer equalized terrestrial attraction lastly even atmosphere whose atoms longer held places would disperse space tiresome retorted michel nothing like matter fact people bringing one back bare reality console michel continued barbicane orb exists whence laws weight banished least going visit one much less earth moon yes moon whose surface objects weigh six times less earth phenomenon easy prove shall feel asked michel
positive,evidently two hundred pounds weigh thirty pounds surface moon muscular strength diminish instead jumping one yard high rise eighteen feet high shall regular herculeses moon exclaimed michel
positive,yes replied nicholl height selenites proportion density globe scarcely foot high lilliputians ejaculated michel shall play part gulliver
neutral,going realize fable giants
positive,advantage leaving one planet running solar world one moment michel answered barbicane wish play part gulliver visit inferior planets mercury venus mars whose density little less earth venture great planets jupiter saturn uranus neptune order changed become lilliputian sun sun density thirteen hundred twenty four thousand times greater attraction twenty seven times greater surface globe keeping everything proportion inhabitants ought least two hundred feet high jove exclaimed michel nothing pigmy shrimp gulliver giants said nicholl
neutral,replied barbicane
positive,would quite useless carry pieces artillery defend oneself good replied nicholl projectiles would effect sun would fall back upon earth minutes strong remark certain replied barbicane attraction great enormous orb object weighing 70 000 pounds earth would weigh 1 920 pounds surface sun
positive,fall upon would weigh let see 5 000 pounds weight would never able raise devil said michel one would want portable crane
positive,however satisfied moon present least shall cut great figure
positive,one single hypothesis remained realized arrival projectile destination action lunar attraction
positive,reality fall 8 296 leagues orb true weight could reckoned one sixth terrestrial weight formidable fall nevertheless one every precaution must taken without delay
negative,precautions two sorts deaden shock projectile touch lunar soil others delay fall consequently make less violent
negative,deaden shock pity barbicane longer able employ means ably weakened shock departure say water used springs partition breaks
positive,partitions still existed water failed could use reserve precious case first days liquid element found wanting lunar soil
neutral,indeed reserve would quite insufficient spring
neutral,layer water stored projectile time starting upon journey occupied less three feet depth spread surface less fifty four square feet
positive,besides cistern contain one fifth part must therefore give efficient means deadening shock arrival
positive,happily barbicane content employing water furnished movable disc strong spring plugs destined lessen shock base breaking horizontal partitions
positive,plugs still existed readjust replace movable disc every piece easy handle weight scarcely felt quickly mounted
positive,different pieces fitted without trouble matter bolts screws tools wanting soon reinstated disc lay steel plugs like table legs
negative,one inconvenience resulted replacing disc lower window blocked thus impossible travelers observe moon opening precipitated perpendicularly upon obliged give even side openings could still see vast lunar regions aeronaut sees earth car
neutral,replacing disc least hour work
neutral,past twelve preparations finished
positive,barbicane took fresh observations inclination projectile annoyance turned sufficiently fall seemed take curve parallel lunar disc
positive,orb night shone splendidly space opposite orb day blazed fire
negative,situation began make uneasy
positive,reaching destination said nicholl
positive,let us act reaching replied barbicane
negative,sceptical retorted michel ardan
positive,shall arrive quicker like answer brought barbicane back preparations occupied placing contrivances intended break descent
negative,may remember scene meeting held tampa town florida captain nicholl came forward barbicane enemy michel ardan adversary
positive,captain nicholl maintaining projectile would smash like glass michel replied would break fall means rockets properly placed
positive,thus powerful fireworks taking starting point base bursting outside could producing recoil check certain degree projectile speed
positive,rockets burn space true oxygen would fail could supply like lunar volcanoes burning never yet stopped want atmosphere round moon
negative,barbicane accordingly supplied fireworks enclosed little steel guns could screwed base projectile
neutral,inside guns flush bottom outside protruded eighteen inches
neutral,twenty
neutral,opening left disc allowed light match provided
neutral,effect felt outside
negative,burning mixture already rammed gun
neutral,nothing raise metallic buffers fixed base replace guns fitted closely places
neutral,new work finished three clock taking precautions remained wait
positive,projectile perceptibly nearing moon evidently succumbed influence certain degree though velocity also drew oblique direction
negative,conflicting influences resulted line might become tangent
positive,certain projectile would fall directly moon lower part reason weight ought turned toward
positive,barbicane uneasiness increased saw projectile resist influence gravitation
neutral,unknown opening unknown interplanetary space
positive,man science thought foreseen three hypotheses possible return earth return moon stagnation neutral line fourth hypothesis big terrors infinite surged inopportunely
positive,face without flinching one must resolute savant like barbicane phlegmatic like nicholl audacious adventurer like michel ardan
neutral,conversation started upon subject
neutral,men would considered question practical point view would asked whither projectile carriage carrying
neutral,sought cause produced effect
negative,become diverted route said michel much fear answered nicholl spite precautions taken columbiad fairly pointed

neutral,become selenites
neutral,idea brought question habitability moon
positive,seen could travelers solve
neutral,would decide
positive,michel ardan persuaded two friends form opinion asked directly thought men animals represented lunar world
neutral,think answer said barbicane according idea question ought put form
neutral,ask put differently put way replied michel
neutral,continued barbicane
negative,problem double one requires double solution
neutral,moon habitable
positive,moon ever inhabitable good replied nicholl
positive,first let us see whether moon habitable tell truth know nothing answered michel
negative,answer negative continued barbicane
negative,actual state surrounding atmosphere certainly much reduced seas part dried insufficient supply water restricted vegetation sudden alternations cold heat days nights 354 hours moon seem habitable seem propitious animal development sufficient wants existence understand agreed replied nicholl
negative,moon habitable creatures differently organized question difficult answer try ask nicholl motion appears necessary result life whatever organization without doubt answered nicholl
positive,worthy companion would answer observed lunar continent distance 500 yards nothing seemed us move moon surface
negative,presence kind life would betrayed attendant marks divers buildings even ruins
neutral,seen
neutral,everywhere always geological works nature never work man
positive,exist representatives animal kingdom moon must fled unfathomable cavities eye cannot reach cannot admit must left traces passage plains atmosphere must cover however slightly raised may
neutral,traces nowhere visible
positive,remains one hypothesis living race motion life foreign one might well say living creatures live replied michel
neutral,said barbicane us meaning may form opinion said michel
positive,yes replied nicholl
negative,well continued michel ardan scientific commission assembled projectile gun club founded argument facts recently observed decide unanimously upon question habitability moon moon habitable decision consigned president barbicane notebook process sitting 6th december may seen
negative,said nicholl let us attack second question indispensable complement first
positive,ask honorable commission moon habitable ever inhabited citizen barbicane friends replied barbicane undertake journey order form opinion past habitability satellite add personal observations confirm opinion
positive,believe indeed affirm moon inhabited human race organized like produced animals anatomically formed like terrestrial animals add races human animal day forever extinct asked michel moon must older earth said barbicane decidedly world grown old quicker whose formation deformation rapid
negative,relatively organizing force matter much violent interior moon interior terrestrial globe
neutral,actual state cracked twisted burst disc abundantly proves
neutral,moon earth nothing gaseous masses originally
positive,gases passed liquid state different influences solid masses formed later
positive,certainly sphere still gaseous liquid moon solidified cooling become habitable believe said nicholl
neutral,continued barbicane atmosphere surrounded waters contained within gaseous envelope could evaporate
positive,influence air water light solar heat central heat vegetation took possession continents prepared receive certainly life showed period nature expend vain world wonderfully formed habitation must necessarily inhabited said nicholl many phenomena inherent satellite might cramp expansion animal vegetable kingdom
neutral,example days nights 354 hours terrestrial poles last six months said michel
positive,argument little value since poles inhabited let us observe friends continued barbicane actual state moon long nights long days created differences temperature insupportable organization historical period time
positive,atmosphere enveloped disc fluid mantle vapor deposited shape clouds natural screen tempered ardor solar rays retained nocturnal radiation
positive,light like heat diffuse air hence equality influences longer exists atmosphere almost entirely disappeared
neutral,going astonish astonish us said michel ardan
neutral,firmly believe period moon inhabited nights days last 354 hours asked nicholl quickly
positive,probably rotary motion moon upon axis equal revolution equality presents part disc fifteen days action solar rays granted replied nicholl two motions equal really equality determined terrestrial attraction
positive,say attraction powerful enough alter motion moon period earth still fluid replied nicholl say moon always satellite earth say exclaimed michel ardan moon exist earth imaginations carried away indefinite field hypothesis
neutral,barbicane sought restrain
negative,speculations high said problems utterly insoluble
neutral,let us enter upon
positive,let us admit insufficiency primordial attraction inequality two motions rotation revolution days nights could succeeded moon succeed earth
positive,besides even without conditions life possible asked michel ardan humanity disappeared moon yes replied barbicane doubtless remained persistently millions centuries degrees atmosphere becoming rarefied disc became uninhabitable terrestrial globe one day become cooling cooling certainly replied barbicane internal fires became extinguished incandescent matter concentrated lunar crust cooled
neutral,degrees consequences phenomena showed disappearance organized beings disappearance vegetation
positive,soon atmosphere rarefied probably withdrawn terrestrial attraction aerial departure respirable air disappearance water means evaporation
neutral,period moon becoming uninhabitable longer inhabited
positive,dead world see day say fate store earth probably cooling crust shall made uninhabitable calculated time unfortunate sphere take cool certainly know calculations perfectly speak clumsy savant exclaimed michel ardan make boil impatience well good michel replied barbicane quietly know diminution temperature earth undergoes lapse century
positive,according certain calculations mean temperature period 400 000 years brought zero four hundred thousand years exclaimed michel
neutral,ah
neutral,breathe
positive,really frightened hear imagined 50 000 years live barbicane nicholl could help laughing companion uneasiness
neutral,nicholl wished end discussion put second question considered
neutral,moon inhabited asked
neutral,answer unanimously affirmative
positive,discussion fruitful somewhat hazardous theories projectile rapidly leaving moon lineaments faded away travelers eyes mountains confused distance wonderful strange fantastical form earth satellite soon remained nothing imperishable remembrance
neutral,projectile position regard moon altered base turned earth
negative,change barbicane verified fail surprise
neutral,projectile gravitate round satellite elliptical orbit heaviest part turned toward moon turns earth
negative,difficult point
neutral,watching course projectile could see leaving moon followed course analogous traced approaching
positive,describing long ellipse would likely extend point equal attraction influences earth satellite neutralized
positive,conclusion barbicane justly drew facts already observed conviction two friends shared
negative,arrived dead point become us asked michel ardan
neutral,know replied barbicane
positive,one draw hypotheses suppose two answered barbicane either projectile speed insufficient remain forever immovable line double attraction prefer hypothesis whatever may interrupted michel
positive,continued barbicane speed sufficient continue elliptical course gravitate forever around orb night revolution consoling said michel pass state humble servants moon accustomed look upon handmaid
neutral,fate store us neither barbicane nicholl answered
negative,answer continued michel impatiently
neutral,nothing answer said nicholl
neutral,nothing try answered barbicane
negative,pretend fight impossible
positive,one frenchman two americans shrink word would subdue motion bearing us away subdue yes continued michel getting animated else alter employ accomplishment ends affair
neutral,artillerymen masters projectile artillerymen
positive,projectile command gunner better ram gunner gun
positive,faith
positive,fine savants
negative,know become us inducing inducing cried barbicane nicholl
neutral,inducing
neutral,mean recrimination said michel
positive,complain trip pleased projectile agrees let us humanly possible fall somewhere even moon ask better worthy michel replied barbicane means fail us cannot alter motion projectile diminish speed even lightening lighten overloaded vessel would throw said nicholl
positive,ballast board indeed seems lightened would go much quicker slower quicker neither slower quicker said barbicane wishing make two friends agree float space must longer consider specific weight well cried michel ardan decided voice remains one thing asked nicholl
positive,breakfast answered cool audacious frenchman always brought solution difficult juncture
neutral,case operation influence projectile course could least tried without inconvenience even success stomachic point view
positive,certainly michel none good ideas
neutral,breakfasted two morning hour mattered little
positive,michel served usual repast crowned glorious bottle drawn private cellar
negative,ideas crowd brains must despair chambertin 1853
neutral,repast finished observation began
neutral,around projectile invariable distance objects thrown

positive,motive body circulating round attracting body fails law
neutral,every orbit described space elliptical
positive,projectile gun club escape natural arrangement
positive,elliptical orbits attracting body always occupies one foci one moment satellite nearer another farther orb around gravitates
neutral,earth nearest sun perihelion aphelion farthest point
neutral,speaking moon nearest earth perigee farthest apogee
neutral,use analogous expressions astronomers language enriched projectile remains satellite moon must say aposelene farthest point periselene nearest
neutral,latter case projectile would attain maximum speed former minimum
positive,evidently moving toward aposelenitical point barbicane reason think speed would decrease point increase degrees neared moon
positive,speed would even become nil point joined equal attraction
negative,barbicane studied consequences different situations thinking inference could draw roughly disturbed cry michel ardan
positive,jove exclaimed must admit right simpletons say replied barbicane simple means checking speed bearing us moon use means use recoil contained rockets done said nicholl
positive,used force yet said barbicane true asked michel
neutral,time comes
positive,observe friends position occupied projectile oblique position regard lunar disc rockets slightly altering direction might turn moon instead drawing nearer replied michel
neutral,let us wait
neutral,inexplicable influence projectile turning base toward earth
positive,probable point equal attraction conical cap directed rigidly toward moon moment may hope speed nil moment act influence rockets may perhaps provoke fall directly surface lunar disc bravo said michel
positive,could first passage dead point projectile endowed great speed well reasoned said nicholl
neutral,let us wait patiently continued barbicane
positive,putting every chance side much despaired may say think shall gain end conclusion signal michel ardan hips hurrahs

positive,hours representing time traveled carefully noted calculation easy
positive,barbicane found point would reached one morning night 7th 8th december
positive,nothing interfered course would reach given point twenty two hours
neutral,rockets primarily placed check fall projectile upon moon going employ directly contrary purpose
positive,case ready wait moment set fire
neutral,since nothing else done said nicholl make proposition asked barbicane
neutral,propose go sleep motion exclaimed michel ardan
neutral,forty hours since closed eyes said nicholl
positive,hours sleep restore strength never interrupted michel
positive,well continued nicholl every one taste shall go sleep stretching divan soon snored like forty eight pounder
