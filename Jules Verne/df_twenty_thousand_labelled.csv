negative,useless attack ceiling like surface since iceberg measured 400 yards height
neutral,captain nemo sounded lower surface
positive,ten yards wall separated us water great thickness ice field
negative,necessary therefore cut piece equal extent waterline nautilus
neutral,6 000 cubic yards detach dig hole could descend ice field
neutral,work begun immediately carried indefatigable energy
positive,instead digging round nautilus would involved greater difficulty captain nemo immense trench made eight yards port quarter
neutral,men set work simultaneously screws several points circumference
negative,presently pickaxe attacked compact matter vigorously large blocks detached mass
positive,curious effect specific gravity blocks lighter water fled speak vault tunnel increased thickness top proportion diminished base

positive,air renewed forty eight hours vivifying qualities considerably enfeebled
negative,however lapse twelve hours raised block ice one yard thick marked surface 600 cubic yards
positive,reckoning took twelve hours accomplish much would take five nights four days bring enterprise satisfactory conclusion
neutral,five nights four days
neutral,air enough two days reservoirs
negative,without taking account said ned even get infernal prison shall also imprisoned iceberg shut possible communication atmosphere true enough
neutral,could foresee minimum time necessary deliverance
neutral,might suffocated nautilus could regain surface waves
neutral,destined perish ice tomb enclosed
negative,situation terrible
neutral,everyone looked danger face determined duty last
negative,expected night new block yard square carried away still sank immense hollow

positive,presence new imminent danger would become chances safety hinder solidification liquid medium would burst partitions nautilus like glass
negative,tell companions new danger
neutral,good damping energy displayed painful work escape
negative,went board told captain nemo grave complication
negative,know said calm tone could counteract terrible apprehensions
neutral,one danger see way escaping chance safety go quicker solidification
neutral,must beforehand day several hours used pickaxe vigorously
neutral,work kept
positive,besides work quit nautilus breathe directly pure air drawn reservoirs supplied apparatus quit impoverished vitiated atmosphere
neutral,towards evening trench dug one yard deeper
neutral,returned board nearly suffocated carbonic acid air filled ah
neutral,chemical means drive away deleterious gas
positive,plenty oxygen water contained considerable quantity dissolving powerful piles would restore vivifying fluid
positive,thought well good since carbonic acid produced respiration invaded every part vessel
negative,absorb necessary fill jars caustic potash shake incessantly
neutral,substance wanting board nothing could replace
positive,evening captain nemo ought open taps reservoirs let pure air interior nautilus without precaution could get rid sense suffocation
neutral,next day march 26th resumed miner work beginning fifth yard

negative,aronnax must attempt desperate means shall sealed solidified water cement yes done ah
positive,nautilus strong enough bear pressure without crushed well asked catching captain idea
positive,understand replied congelation water help us
neutral,see solidification would burst field ice imprisons us freezes bursts hardest stones
negative,perceive would agent safety instead destruction yes captain perhaps
negative,whatever resistance crushing nautilus possesses could support terrible pressure would flattened like iron plate know sir
neutral,therefore must reckon aid nature exertions
negative,must stop solidification
neutral,side walls pressed together ten feet water behind nautilus
positive,congelation gains us sides long air reservoirs last us breathe board captain looked face
